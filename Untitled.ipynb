The reason theirs did not work was because the if and else were all lined up together which doesn't show each being sperated, it clumps it all together so it doesn't allow to have different outcomes. I had to type in what each score would be starting from A_score, then would use symbols like >= to represent greater than or equal to, and if it was true it would print the statement below, if it was not true then it would go to the else statement but that leads to a new line of \"if\" which shows the next printed statement of which letter score it is. At the end of the coding I typed in score= and entered a random number of 69 which shows final answer of the grade being a D because thats what the number falls under. \n",
